Explanation Document for Submitted Spectrum Folders

We have sent you two folders containing spectrum data: one with “good” spectra and one with “bad” spectra.
Each folder includes 10 sample cases.

Within each sample folder, you will find screenshots from our proprietary LTA software (developed by ADOM). In the annotation section of these screenshots, the measurement timestamp is indicated in milliseconds.
For example, a timestamp of 5794 refers to 5.794 seconds, which you can match to the blue data point at 5.79 seconds in the interpretation chart.

Please note:

If the “Aqueous” value is marked as -1 or -2, there will be no blue data point displayed on the chart. This means the LTA software identified that point as invalid and discarded it.

In the screenshots, you will only see the “Aqueous” value. However, in the full chart, the value labeled “Mucus-Aqueous” represents the “Aqueous” value plus a constant 500 nm (nanometers).
For example, if the screenshot shows an Aqueous value of 2337, the corresponding blue point in the full chart will be found at 2837 nm.

Each sample also contains a second screenshot showing the amplitude spectrum (file names ending with _GOP).
This chart represents only the amplitude (i.e., the deviation from a smooth curve), and is generated automatically by the LTA software. I often use this chart to evaluate the quality of the fit between measured and theoretical spectra.

In addition, we have attached:

The measured spectrum file, after normalization and other corrections (these are the files we use for our interpretation/analysis).

The theoretical (BestFit) spectrum file, which was matched to each measurement (file names ending with _BestFit).

Additional Files for Your Convenience

In the explanation folder, I have also included the following files for your convenience:

Mucus-Aqueous_Height: Contains all blue data points with their corresponding timestamps.

Blink: Contains the blink times. (Only the first column is relevant—the blink timestamp. The second column can be ignored; it is not relevant for display.)

AllLayersGraph.bmp: This is the full chart I referred to above, showing all relevant data layers.

Additionally, I have attached the final report (Report.pdf) that was previously sent to our customers.
You may notice several changes between this final report and the current run I have sent you now.

If you have any questions or require further clarification, please let us know.
